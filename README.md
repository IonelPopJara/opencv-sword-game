# Unity OpenCV Sword Game

A small prototype inspired by Wii Sports Resorts's Sword Game and developed in Uniity. The main idea was to utilize OpenCV and a WebCam to track the motion of the player and simulate the use of the Wii MotionPlus.

If you would like to check a preview of the project, you can watch [this video here](https://youtu.be/l1oq7TMTVK0).

For the motion tracking app developed in C# and .NET refer to [the following repo](https://github.com/IonelPopJara/opencv-sword-game-app).
